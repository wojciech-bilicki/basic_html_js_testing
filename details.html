        William Michael Albert Broad[1] (born 30 November 1955), known professionally as Billy Idol, is an English musician, singer,
        songwriter, and actor. He first achieved fame in the 1970s as a member of the punk rock band Generation X. Subsequently,
        he embarked on a solo career which led to international recognition and made Idol one of the lead artists during
        the MTV-driven "Second British Invasion" in the United States. Idol began his career in late 1975 as a guitarist
        in the punk rock band Chelsea. However, he soon left the group and along with his bandmate Tony James formed Generation
        X with Idol being the lead singer. The band achieved success in the United Kingdom and released three albums on Chrysalis
        Records before disbanding. In 1981, Idol moved to New York City to pursue his solo career in collaboration with guitarist
        Steve Stevens. His debut studio album Billy Idol (1982) was a commercial success and with music videos for singles
        "Dancing with Myself" and "White Wedding" Idol soon became a staple of then newly established MTV.
